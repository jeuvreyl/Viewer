Just something to learn Flask and its extensions, work as an image gallery with thumbnail generation.
Use Flask for web part and Pillow for thumbnails, images are stored in a sqlite database.

Still have a LOT of room for improvements: functionnality / project structure / packaging / etc
Will switch to Angular JS / Flask-REST one day.
